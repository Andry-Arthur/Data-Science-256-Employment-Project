### Data Science Programming (DS-256) Class Group Project
This is a collaborative work on analyzing the impact of immigrants and nonimmigrant workers by Andry Rakotonjanabelo, Ha Phung, and Rockia Sy for our Data Science Programming class. 

This project explores Immigration and Labor Statistics data to find potential correlation between Immigrants & Nonimmigrants to U.S. employment.

The final compiled data, named "Employment_and_Non-Immigrant_Workers.csv", has the following columns:
**year**: Fiscal year (from 2009-2023).\
**hiring**: Total levels of hiring for given year (seasonally-adjusted). \ 
**separation**: Total levels of separation for given year (seasonally-adjusted).\
**opening**: Total job levels of opening for given year (seasonally-adjusted).\
**H1B_approved**: Total Approved H-1B Applications for initial employment for given year.\
**H1B_denied**: Total Denied H-1B Applications for initial employment for given year.\
**H1B_total**: Total H-1B Applications for initial employment for given year.\

More details of the granular, constituent data making up the .csv file mentioned above are provided in the attached python notebook labeled 'Andry Data Processing, Analysis, and Packaging'.
